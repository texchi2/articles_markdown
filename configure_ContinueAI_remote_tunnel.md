Let me help you configure Continue AI agent to work with VS Code tunnel. Looking at the documentation link you shared, we need to ensure proper remote access.
(or gptstudio/Ollama Connection)

Based on the search results, here's how to configure Continue to work with VS Code tunnel access:

1. First, modify Ollama server configuration to allow remote access:
```bash
# On your MacStudio (server), set environment variable in .zshrc
export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0
# Restart Ollama
#sudo systemctl restart ollama  # if using systemd
brew services restart ollama # if brew installed
# or restart the Ollama app
ollama serve
```

2. Update Continue's config.json with the proper remote address. The config should be in `~/.continue/config.json` on the client (Macbook Air):
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Llama 3.3 70B",
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model": "llama3.3:70b",
      "baseUrl": "http://192.168.192.79:11434",  // Changed from localhost
      "apiBase": "http://192.168.192.79:11434"  // keypoint ***
    }
  ],
  "tabAutocompleteModel": {
    "title": "Llama Local",
    "provider": "ollama",
    "model": "llama3.3:70b",
    "baseUrl": "http://192.168.192.79:11434"  // Changed from localhost
  }
  // ... rest of your config
}
```

3. Set up SSH tunnel for secure access (optional but recommended):
```bash
# On your MacBook Air (client)
# ssh -L 11434:localhost:11434 username@macstudio-ip
ssh -L 11434:localhost:11434 texchi@192.168.192.79  

```

4. Configure VS Code tunnel settings:
```json
// In VS Code settings.json on MacBook Air
{
  "remote.SSH.enableRemoteCommand": true,
  "remote.SSH.allowLocalServerDownload": true,
  "remote.tunnels.access.preventSleep": true
}
```

5. Verify network access:
```bash
# On MacStudio, check if Ollama is listening on all interfaces
netstat -an | grep 11434

# Test Ollama API access
curl http://macstudio-ip:11434/api/tags
# on server: GET /api/tags
```

If you're still having issues:
1. Check firewall settings:
```bash
# On MacStudio
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 11434
```

2. Verify Ollama logs:
```bash
tail -f ~/.ollama/logs/ollama.log
```

Would you like me to help you test the connection or troubleshoot any specific issues?

=> Finaly step:
That's the correct solution. The EHOSTUNREACH error was due to macOS security settings blocking VS Code from accessing local network resources. 
=> Going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Network and enabling local network access for VS Code fixes the connectivity issue between Continue extension and the remote Ollama server.
This is a common security requirement in macOS Ventura and later versions for apps trying to access network resources.
